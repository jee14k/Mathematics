Topic 6: Taylor series
	Mclauren's series

eg - find the first 5 terms of the taylor series for f(x) = ........... centred at c=2, plot together with linear,quadratic, cubic,biquadratic taylor approximations near c=2

Synatx - and 2 examples

Output(graph)
n=2			n=4

n=6			n=8 


question expand y=f(x) using T.S with 2,4,6,8 terms

output: graph - linear,quadratic, cubic,biquadratic
